Bianchi Accountants Website – things that need sorting out.

1.	Bianchi accountants logo at the top of the screen is too small – needs to double in size (approx.)
2.	Any way we can change the blue colour of the background images – this seems to be a legacy thing from the initial theme
3.	Half way down the main page “we help business grow “ there is a blue box that is some sort of button that takes you back to the home page – I want to delete it
4.	Our Services – any way we can have this set as two columns of two?
5.	Our services – any chance we could remove the bullet points from this page and simply have the text from the title page of each? i.e. Individuals – on the home page this should say INDIVIDUALS – we offer tailored support to our clients covering the areas you require – then when you click on the link you go through to the dedicated individuals page with the bullet point list
6.	Any chance of including bullet points to the lists – I can for the life of me work it out? This would be good for each of the four service pages.
7.	Bottom part of main page – this is sort of an about section – can we left justify the text and not have it centred?
8.	Text at the bottom (about) on main page is likely to change as it simply replicates whats on the about page.
9.	Footer – any way to remove the ref to www.zerostatic.io I think that’s a legacy thing from the original theme
